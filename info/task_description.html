    A ring topology is a network configuration where the devices are connected to each other in a circular shape.
    Optical rings are widely used in mobile networks, to transport the traffic from the base station to the backbone, through the mobile backhaul.

    For the sake of simplicity, in this task, we define a ring as a connex graph which vertexes have a degree 2 and are connected to two distinct vertexes.
    This ensures that there is a single link between each pair of adjacent nodes. 
    Ring are represented as a string made of distinct letters, which position in the string is also the position in the ring.
    For instance, the ring "AEFCBG" defines the following topology:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only"
         title="ring definition"
         src="{{MEDIA}}ring-def.PNG"
         alt="ring definition"
         width="327px"/>
</p>

<p>
    Multiple traffic flows will be routed on the ring. A traffic flow is represented as a couple (s, dr) where s is a string of length 2, containing the ingress node and the egress node, and dr is the data rate in Gbps (gigabit per second).
    Each flow will be routed on the shortest path from the ingress node to the egress node. If there are two shortest paths, the path which order fits the ring definition will be kept.
    Let's consider the following situation:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only"
         title="paths along the ring"
         src="{{MEDIA}}ring-paths.PNG"
         alt="paths along the ring"
         width="327px"/>
</p>

<p>
    The path from A to B (and vice versa) will be "A - G - B", because it uses only two links, while the path going the other way around ("A - E - F - C - B") uses five links.
    However, there are two paths of equal length to go from A to C: "A - E - F - C" and "A - G - B - C". The first one, "A - E - F - C", will be kept: it is the same order as in the ring definition (AEFCBG").
    The traffic from C to A will use the path "C - B - G - A": the routing is asymmetric in that case.

    In this example, "d" is degrees, "m" is minutes, "s" is seconds as integers, while "X" is "N"
    (north) or "S" (south) for a latitude and "W" (west) or "E" (east) for a longitude.

<p>
    The result should be given as a number in kilometers with a precision of ±0.1 (100 metres).

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    The concepts presented in this mission are the exact sorts of concepts used in navigational
    software, enabling a ship or plane to understand where it is, where it must go and how far it
    has gone. Along the same vein, Global Positioning Satellites use similar principles to
    provide pinpoint accurate locations to GPS receivers for use in navigation.
