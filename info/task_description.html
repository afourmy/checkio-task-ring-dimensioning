    A ring topology is a network configuration where the devices are connected to each other in a circular shape.
    Optical rings are widely used in mobile networks, to transport the traffic from the base station to the backbone, through the mobile backhaul.

    For the sake of simplicity, in this task, we define a ring as a connex graph which vertexes have a degree 2 and are connected to two distinct vertexes.
    This ensures that there is a single link between each pair of adjacent nodes. 
    Ring are represented as a string made of distinct letters, which position in the string is also the position in the ring.
    For instance, the ring "AEFCBG" defines the following topology:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only"
         title="ring definition"

         alt="ring definition"
         width="327px"/>
</p>

<p>
    Coordinates are given as a string with the latitude and longitude separated by comma and/or whitespace.
    Latitude and longitude are represented in the follow format:
</p>

<pre>
    d°m′s″X
</pre>
<br>
<p>
    In this example, "d" is degrees, "m" is minutes, "s" is seconds as integers, while "X" is "N"
    (north) or "S" (south) for a latitude and "W" (west) or "E" (east) for a longitude.
</p>

<p>
    The result should be given as a number in kilometers with a precision of ±0.1 (100 metres).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> Two arguments. Coordinates as strings (unicode).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> The distance as a number (int or float).

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    The concepts presented in this mission are the exact sorts of concepts used in navigational
    software, enabling a ship or plane to understand where it is, where it must go and how far it
    has gone. Along the same vein, Global Positioning Satellites use similar principles to
    provide pinpoint accurate locations to GPS receivers for use in navigation.

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    Correct Coordinates.
