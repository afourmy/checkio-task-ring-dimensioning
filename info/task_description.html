<p>
    A ring topology is a network configuration where the devices are connected to each other in a circular shape.
    Optical rings are widely used in mobile networks, to transport the traffic from a base station to the backbone, through the mobile backhaul.
</p>

<p>
    For the sake of simplicity, in this task, we define a ring as a connex graph which vertexes:
    <br><br>
	<ol>
		<li style="padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 10%; width: 80%;">- have a degree <strong>2</strong>, which means there are <strong>2</strong> incident edges.</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 10%; width: 80%;">- are connected to two distinct vertexes</li>
	</ol>
    
    These two conditions ensure that there is a single link between each pair of adjacent nodes. 
    Ring are represented as a string made of distinct letters, which position in the string is also the position in the ring.
    For instance, the ring "AEFCBG" defines the following topology:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only"
         title="ring definition"
         src="{{MEDIA}}ring-def.PNG"
         alt="ring definition"
         width="500px"/>
</p>
<h3>Shortest path asymmetric routing</h3>
<p>
    Multiple traffic flows will be routed on the ring. <br>
    Each flow will be routed on the shortest path from the ingress node to the egress node.<br> If there are two shortest paths, <strong>the path which order fits the ring definition will be kept.</strong>
    Let's consider the following situation:<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only"
         title="paths along the ring"
         src="{{MEDIA}}ring-paths.PNG"
         alt="paths along the ring"
         width="500px"/>
</p>

<p>
    The path from A to B (and vice versa) will be "A - G - B", because it uses only two links, while the path going the other way around ("A - E - F - C - B") uses five links.
    However, there are two paths of equal length to go from A to C: "A - E - F - C" and "A - G - B - C". The first one, "A - E - F - C", will be kept: it is the same order as in the ring definition (AEFCBG").
    The traffic from C to A will use the path "C - B - G - A": the routing is asymmetric in that case.
</p>
<h3>Flow aggregation</h3>
<p>
    A traffic flow is represented as a couple <strong>(s, dr)</strong> where: 
        <br><br>
	<ol>
		<li style="padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 10%; width: 80%;">- <strong>s</strong> is a string of length 2, containing the <strong>ingress node</strong> (starting point of the traffic) and the <strong>egress node</strong> (exit point of the traffic).</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 10%; width: 80%;">- <strong>dr</strong> is the data rate in Gbps (gigabit per second).</li>
	</ol><br>
    The data rate of a traffic flow will be counted for all the links of the shortest path. A traffic flow ("AB", 5) means that 5 Gbps will be routed on the shortest path from A to C. 
    We will count 5 Gbps on the link "AG" and 5 Gbps on the link "GB". For a traffic flow ("CA", 15), we will count 15 Gbps on the links "CB", "BG", and "GA".
    Given a list of traffic flows, we consider the resulting bandwidth for each link of the ring.
</p>

<h3>Ethernet links dimensioning</h3>
<p>
    There are five main types of Ethernet links used in mobile networks:
            <br><br>
	<ol>
		<li style="padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 10%; width: 80%;">- <strong>Fast Ethernet</strong> (FE): 100 Mbps (or 0.1 Gbps) </li>
		<li style="padding-left: 10%; width: 80%;">- <strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong> (GE): 1 Gbps.</li>
		<li style="padding-top: 8px; padding-left: 10%; width: 80%;">- <strong>10 Gigabit Ethernet</strong> (FE): 10 Gbps </li>
		<li style="padding-left: 10%; width: 80%;">- <strong>40 Gigabit Ethernet</strong> (40GE): 40 Gbps.</li>
		<li style="padding-left: 10%; width: 80%;">- <strong>100 Gigabit Ethernet</strong> (100GE): 100 Gbps.</li>
	</ol><br>
</p>
<p>
    In order to define which type of link we use, we look for the smallest bandwidth allowing to carry the whole traffic with a single link.
    Handling a 5-Gbps traffic would require 50 FE links, 5 GE links, or 1 10GE link. Therefore, a 10GE Ethernet link will be used.
    For a 15-Gbps traffic, a 40GE Ethernet link would be required. For a traffic higher than 100 Gbps, we use 100GE Ethenet links.
    For a 101-Gbps traffic, 2 100GE links would be required.
</p>
<p>
    Given a ring and a list of traffic flows, you should return the number of Ethernet links of each type that are required to carry the resulting bandwidth:
</p>

<p style="text-align: center;">
    <img class="for_info_only"
         title="resulting dimensioning"
         src="{{["INFO", "MEDIA"]}}ring-dimensioning.PNG"
         alt="resulting dimensioning"
         width="700px"/>
</p>

<br>
<p>
    In this example, we have 10 Gbps from E to C, 5 Gbps from A to C and 60 Gbps from A to B.
    These traffic flows induce the following bandwidth: 15 Gbps from E to C, 5 Gbps from A to E and 60 Gbps from A to B.
    The link dimensioning results in 2 100GE, 2 40GE and 1 10GE Ethernet links.
</p>

<p>
    The result should be given as a list containing the number of links for each category, from 100GE to FE.
    In our example, the result is [2, 2, 1, 0, 0]
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Input: </strong> A variable number of arguments. The first one is a ring, represented as a string where each character is a node. 
    The remaining arguments are traffic flows, represented as a couple (s, dr) where A is a 2-characters string (ingress node, egress node) and B is a positive value (traffic in Gbps).
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Output: </strong> A list with 5 integers, one per type of link, in decreasing order of bandwidth capacity.

    <strong>How it is used: </strong>
    Dimensioning is used for network planning and design.
    For real networks, various softwares are used to dimension the network based on the expected traffic load (for pre-sales engineers, when the network does not yet exist), or traffic measurements (for post-sales engineers, to see how much traffic the network can handle). 
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Precondition:</strong>
    The ring is a valid ring (connex, 2-degree nodes).
    The traffic is a positive value (integer or float).
